# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction (ML Pipeline)

Predicting heart disease risk using machine learning on the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** for heart disease prediction:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
2. **Feature Selection** (Random Forest, RFE, Chi-Square)
3. **Dimensionality Reduction** (PCA)
4. **Supervised Learning Models**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - SVM
5. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - K-Means
   - Hierarchical Clustering
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
7. **Model Export** as `.pkl`

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/L-202/Heart_Disease_Project.git`  
`cd Heart_Disease_Project`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook:

`notebooks/Heart_Disease_Full_Pipeline.ipynb`

and run step by step.

2. The final trained model is saved in:

`models/final_model.pkl`

## ✨ Results

- High accuracy achieved across models.
- Random Forest performed best after hyperparameter tuning.
- Model is exported for easy reuse and deployment.
